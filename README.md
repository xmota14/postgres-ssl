## PostgreSQL database server for encrypted access only [ SSL ]

All images in this repository were made and tested to create a PostgreSQL database server so that only encrypted connections can be made for client-server data traffic.

The tests are in the automation phase, the next commits will possibly be with automated tests with Go (Golang).

If anyone wanted to know more about the project contact me in the issues.

I appreciate anyone who can help with the project with new pull requests or issues
